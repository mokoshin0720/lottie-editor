- Always keep `README.md` and related PLAN files up-to-date after making changes.
- While implementing Milestones keep going without asking the user if it wants to continue or not.
- Before finishing a Milestone, always go through the plan again and double-check if all steps have been implemented. For each step find the code that is supposed to implement it and check if it matches the criteria.
- Always call the milestone-validator agent after implementing a milestone, but before commiting it
- If fixing bugs, do not commit until the user has tested it and gives the go ahead
- Call the lottie-spec-expert agent to ask questions about lottie if needed, never assume anything related to lottie, always ask it instead
